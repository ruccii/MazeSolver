# MazeSolver
This project implements various search algorithms to navigate and solve a maze efficiently. It explores different pathfinding techniques, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A (A-star) and Uniform Cost Search (UCS), to determine the optimal route from a start position to a goal within a maze environment.
